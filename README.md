## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the power of the ATmega32 microcontroller to create a versatile voltmeter and ohmmeter system. The voltmeter can accurately measure AC voltage signals, and the ohmmeter can measure resistance values across various ranges. This repository contains the code, circuit diagrams, and instructions to build and use this system.

## Features

- AC Voltmeter: Measures and displays AC voltage on an LCD screen.
- Multi-Range Ohmmeter: Measures resistance across multiple selectable ranges.
- User Interface: Utilizes an LCD keypad for user interaction and result display.
- ATmega32 Microcontroller: The brains behind the operation.
- Versatile and Precise: Suitable for a wide range of electronic projects.
